# Uncommon Dart Error Handling: Ignoring Specific Exceptions

This repository showcases a common but potentially problematic error handling pattern in Dart asynchronous operations.  The example involves fetching data from an API. While the code handles exceptions, it doesn't distinguish between different types of errors and might mask important details. This can lead to difficulties in debugging and identifying the root cause of failures.

## Problem
The `fetchData` function catches a generic `catch (e)` block, which while catching exceptions, provides limited information about the nature of the error.  It also uses `rethrow;` which might not always be the best practice, especially when handling network errors where you might want to retry the request instead of propagating the error up the call stack.

## Solution
The improved version provides more specific exception handling and avoids unnecessary rethrowing of exceptions where appropriate.  It handles `FormatException` and `http.ClientException` specifically, providing more context for the developer. For other exceptions, a more informative error message is still generated and rethrowing is used for higher-level handling.
